Welcome to the Bonsai Sr Data Analyst Test! Our goal for this test is to get a sense of priorities in work, how you work, and the quality of the final product as well! It's not meant to be a huge assignment and you can finish it in your own time.

### The Task

The datasets provided in this test are simplified versions of the data you will find at Bonsai. Your task is to analysze the data and present your results to senior management:
1. Summarizes sales and operations thus far - think about which statistics, metrics, or figures would be important for our business
2. Propose 2-3 areas where the company can improve
3. Any other piece of analysis you find crucial to include that highlight business KPIs

### The Data

1. Orders dataset: 
2. Order items dataset
3. Product dataset
4. Customers dataset

- It is up to you to decide how to combine information from these datasets
- Assume all orders are delivered
- Consider data from 2017-2018

### Some Tips

Think of this test as an open ended problem you are solving. You will decide what direction the analysis takes - but keep in mind that it is a presentation to senior management. Keep your final results brief (it should take ~15 min to go over them).

Having said that, you are still being tested on your analytical skills. As such please provide all code, documents, and your thought process in your submission.

You are free to choose your platform for analysis and presentation. Good luck!
